            <p>The fade assignment tests us students on our abilities to manipulate voltage and pin output using voltage dividers and some fancy Arduino code. I didn't have much of a plan going into this one like last time, but I knew that I wanted to use the RGB LED to make some sort of rainbow effect. Let's see how this went:</p>
            <h3 class="[ header ]">Starting with the Schematic this time</h3>
            <p>Unlike the previous assignment, I had no preset circuit on my board to easily tinker with. Instead, I decided to chunk the parts down one at a time. I knew that I was going to incorporate the <strong>potentiometer as well as the button</strong>.</p>
            <p>Instead of connecting the three components in series, I wanted to reroute the power from the button into the Arduino, then output it to the potentiometer (same with the potentiometer and the three independent LED connections). This was so we could manipulate the signal with code.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>I also wanted to see what the schematic looked liked when it was connected with the Arduino microcontroller. This was more confusing to read because of the circuits crossing and the fact that wiring ground looks weird, but here it is anyways! (Probably will stick to the previous method in future assignments.)</p>

            <h3 class="header">Calculating Resistance</h3>
            <p>The resistors were solved using the DC current of the LEDs, which is 30mA, and the voltage drop of each color. Red and green are the same, with a voltage drop of 1.8V each. Therefore, figuring out ideal resistance is as simple as plugging in values in Ohm's Law (from a 5V input). V = I*R, so R = 160&#8486;. We always want to be equal to or greater than the ideal resistance, so I picked the 220&#8486; resistors for red and green. Blue differs with a voltage drop of 3.3V drop. That value gives me an ideal 85&#8486;, so I used a 100&#8486; resistor for the blue LED in series.</p>
            <h3 class="header">Coding the Button and Potentiometer</h3>
            <p>Now had to code the button and potentiometer. I wanted the button to toggle with a debounce delay, so I used the Arduino IDE's Debouce example and configured it to my pins.</p>
            <p>I wanted the button to toggle the potentiometer, so that became my output for pin 4. The potentiometer was then going to go to pin A0, where it could analog read the variable voltage. The varying voltage was assigned to a maxValue variable; this variable controlled the maximum luminosity of the LED loop.</p>
            <h3 class="header">The LED for loop</h3>
            <p>The LED loop itself was something I made during the 2nd week of class. It is a series of for loops that cycles through which LED of the RGB LED is receiving power while the other two are drained of it. This results is a pattern that constantly shifts colors.</p>

            <p>After all of that work, it was time to see if the program actually worked. After loading it successfully onto my Arduino, and...</p> 
            <img class="[ image ]" src="../static/assignment2/operation-button.gif" alt="GIF of Circuit Running">
            <p>It worked!! Well, I actually already knew the button worked. I had to ensure that the button and potentiometer were giving variable voltage to a standard LED before I tried manipulating the signal with code.</p>

            <p>One effect that I had not anticiapted was the manipulation of speed. This makes sense; as we're decreases the available voltage, the maxValue reads a lower value, making each for loop go through with fewer iterations. The result is a controllable rate for the rainbow animation.</p>
            <p>Overall, I'm happy with my result. It took me a while to figure out how to configure the button and potentiometer, but once we got that down, it was smooth sailing!</p>
