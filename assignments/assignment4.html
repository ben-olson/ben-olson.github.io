            <p>This assignment wanted us to become familiar with using Arduino libraries and non-standard functions, objects, and syntax. I originally really wanted to use the joystick component, but apparently that's just two potentiometers and doesn't need an external library to run (drats!). I settled instead to work with capacitive touch and the servo motor I had.</p>
            <p>The plan was simple: make input from the capacitive sensor spin the motor at a proportional rate. This time, I wanted to start with the code, as I am now familiar enough with the language to not have to compile, run, and debug every line of code.</p>
            <h3 class="[ header ]">Code for the Capacitive Sensor and the Servo Motor</h3>
            <p>The code for this was actually pretty simple, as I had many of the parts made from in-class activity. My capacitive sensor needed time to calibrate, and I have learned how to calibrate since last assignment (yay learning). I added a phase during setup that would pull max and min values from the environment. I also had the basics of the motor down, as it wasn't that much line of code. The program reads a value from the spoon, maps it to a range of 0–180 degrees, then moves the servo by that value. I also have the readings printed to the serial monitor for debugging.</p>

* to a range of 0–180 degrees. These values are outputted to a servo motor, 
* which moves by that number of degrees. The sensor values are also printed

            <h3 class="[ header ]">Wiring the Circuit</h3>
            <p>Wiring circuits has become a lot easier than the first assignment. At this point, I knew that the best method for my success is to chunk out the code to make sure one function works at a time. I started with making sure my spoon was feeding input data, then I tested calibration, then added a calibration indicator via LED before finally adding the servo. Chunking it out this way helped me write code and debug without having to backtrack all the way to step 1 if something went wrong.</p>
            <p>For resistances, the capacitive sensor needed a 1M&#8486; resistor in order for it to read absolute touch. For the yellow LED, the voltage drop of 1.8V...yeah basically I need a 220&#8486; resistor; if you can't take my word for it, go back to <a href="/assignments/assignment2.html">Assignment 2</a> for my rationale.</p>
            <h3 class="[ header ]">Making the Schematic</h3>
            <p>The schematic was my last step. This was also easy and not as time-consuming; I had been getting pretty familiar with <a href="https://www.circuit-diagram.org" rel="no-opener" target="__blank">circuit-diagram.org</a>, the software I use to draw my schematics.</p>

            <p>After everything was done, I uploaded the program and calibrated the sensor by repeatedly tapping the spoon.</p>
            <img class="[ image ]" src="../static/assignment4/calibration.gif" alt="GIF of Calibrating Sensor">
            <p>Then, I waited, and then tapped my finger on the spoon, and...surprise, surprise! It worked.</p>

            <p>This assignment felt really good to complete. I never once had a hiccup or moment of confusion, and I managed to complete all of the parts in half of the time. I can finally put away my circuit box for the weekend and clean my desk space!</p>
